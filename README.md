# Foundry

A CLI for managing Catalyst Community tech stacks and workflows.

## Status

**Phase 1 - Complete**: Foundation built with CLI structure, configuration management, secrets resolution, SSH operations, and host management.

**Next**: Phase 2 will add stack installation (OpenBAO, K3s, Zot registry)

See [implementation-tasks.md](./implementation-tasks.md) for detailed progress tracking.

## Development

This project uses a `tools` bash script instead of Make for better portability.

### Building

```bash
cd v1
./tools build        # Build the foundry binary
./tools build-static # Build a static binary (no CGO)
```

### Testing

```bash
./tools test              # Run unit tests
./tools test-integration  # Run integration tests (requires Docker)
./tools coverage          # Generate coverage report
```

### Other Commands

```bash
./tools lint    # Run linters (gofmt, go vet)
./tools clean   # Remove build artifacts
./tools install # Install to GOPATH/bin
./tools help    # Show all available commands
```
