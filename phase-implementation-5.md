## Manual Verification

```bash
# Test interactive mode
foundry init --interactive

# Test completions
foundry completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/foundry
source /etc/bash_completion.d/foundry
foundry <TAB><TAB>

# Test error messages
foundry stack install  # (with intentional misconfiguration)
# Should see clear error with suggestion

# Test verbosity
foundry --debug stack status
foundry --quiet stack status

# Verify documentation
# Check that all docs are accurate and up-to-date
# Walk through tutorials and verify they work
```
